# testTrojan

install the package by downloading main.py and running `python3 main.py`

generate is a simple script that will generate a few dummy files (and download a cat picture) so you can test it out on a directory without having to risk losing everything. (certain commands only work for unix)

also, running the program (V1.1) will result in the script also being encrypted, meaning that you can't decrypt it without another copy of the file. My advice is to just download it again and run it.

Encrypt/Decrypt mode for each function
